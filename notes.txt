CURRENT UPDATE:
*********Need to test the leave_group, createAccount, AND deleteAccount functions (NONE HAVE BEEN TESTED!!!!!!!)


TO-DO BEFORE SUBMIT:

**problem**: If no previous comments exist, comment input does not show up (need a jinja input statement for this)

- See if we can update SELECT queries with WHERE (passing variables in) so we don't have to return every row in the table
- Our database is very not secure lol
- Need to create a logout route that pops the session variable
- Add Flask cache extension to reduce number of requests to the database
- Add a notifications feature at the home button to alert when any comments are deleted; create this using a trigger on delete from user_posts_comments
- change input fields to on-click-enter submit instead of having a button
- let users edit as well as delete their comments
- test to make sure the database prevents users from having the same email address
- allow users to change their passwords (last)
- add javascript confirm box before users leave a group
- add quicklinks to wishlist from homepage (takes you to within the group)
- Show all wishlists in the home page
- Add change password feature
- Add delete wishlist feature!!!


QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE WE SUBMIT:

- Is it okay to just use cursor.close() after every request instead of teardown_request(exception)? If not, how do we pass an exception?
