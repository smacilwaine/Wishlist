TO-DO BEFORE SUBMIT:

- See if we can update SELECT queries with WHERE (passing variables in) so we don't have to return every row in the table
- Our database is very not secure lol



QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE WE SUBMIT:

- Is it okay to just use cursor.close() after every request instead of teardown_request(exception)? If not, how do we pass an exception?
