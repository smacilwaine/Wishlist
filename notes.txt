CURRENT UPDATE:
- Just added the functionality to show specific groups for a user
- But Sam is not in any groups
- Need to check on the instance:
	- if postgreSQL query is right
	- if Sam is even in any groups


TO-DO BEFORE SUBMIT:

- See if we can update SELECT queries with WHERE (passing variables in) so we don't have to return every row in the table
- Our database is very not secure lol
- Need to create a logout route that pops the session variable


QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE WE SUBMIT:

- Is it okay to just use cursor.close() after every request instead of teardown_request(exception)? If not, how do we pass an exception?
