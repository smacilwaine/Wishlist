CURRENT UPDATE:
- Working on routing for each specific group, transferring gid variable across pages


TO-DO BEFORE SUBMIT:

- See if we can update SELECT queries with WHERE (passing variables in) so we don't have to return every row in the table
- Our database is very not secure lol
- Need to create a logout route that pops the session variable
- Add Flask cache extension to reduce number of requests to the database


QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE WE SUBMIT:

- Is it okay to just use cursor.close() after every request instead of teardown_request(exception)? If not, how do we pass an exception?
